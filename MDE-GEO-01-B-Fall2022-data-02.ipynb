    "\n",
    "Data related ot Earth Science (including Geology, Geophysics, Marine Science, Weather/Climate Science, etc.)  are very heterogeneous, very large and with a variable degree of complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course won't provide an exhaustive view of the entire set of available Earth Science data, nor get into deep data analysis matters, but it will give a general overview of the range of data types, standards and content used in Earth Science. It will also provide an overvirw of available archives and tools available: They evolve fast! file formats not so much, but tools and **services** (more on that later) are increasing in number and capability by the month.\n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. try any search engine, and you will find even journals dealing with those. Skimming through the recent articles can give an idea of what Earth System Data are about... e.g.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Who collects data?**\n",
    "    * Yourself (metadata? ;) )\n",
    "    * Someone else (see above)\n",
    "    * Some organised experiment / institution / system (see above, but more - or less - relaxed..)\n",
    "* **Data vs. metadata**\n",
    "    * Metadata are data about data. In practice, metadata are bits of information needed to use, process or interpret data. Example: map projection information from your GPS coordinates in x, y in meters, but referred to... what?\n",
    "* **Data vs. quicklooks**\n",
    "    * Quicklooks (or previews, or browse data) are typically low resolution ~thumbnail visualisations of complete data products. They can allow quick inspection (but no real analysis) of data without the need to open/visualise real data.\n",
    "* **processing levels, raw vs. processed data**\n",
    "    * data can be available with different levels of processing and science-readiness, i.e. images collected by a sensor (e.g. a CCD) with units in voltage, or digital number, or some physical quantity. All three data representation might exist, but the one more directly usable is the **higher processing level** one, e..g the physical quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset vs. data product\n",
    "* For your own data, the distinction might be more blurred, e.g. a data product could be your notebook notes in a field station, a dataset the entire day of work, or the entire campaign. E.g. [this](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1084885) is a dataset\n",
    "* A data product (or data granule) is typically the smallest granularity possible to search/discover and download, but that, depending on the way to access data, can be flexible. Example: if a camera collects several images, each is a data product, but each image has possibly millions of pixels and each of them can be accessed, as sub-granule. Tools or services might provide access to various levels of granularity. The higher the flexibility, the easier is to get exactly one needs/want (without downloading huge files).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data vs. Data services\n",
    "\n",
    "Data access can be provided via services that are either used via web interface or more or less programmatically. Most modern institutional data providers use for Earth Science data some sort of web mapping services, e.g. see [USGS 3DEP view](https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic/?basemap=b1&category=ned,nedsrc&title=3DEP%20View).\n",
